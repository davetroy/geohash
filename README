== DESCRIPTION:

GeoHash Gem for Ruby (c) 2008 David Troy
dave@roundhousetech.com

Geohash is a latitude/longitude encoding system invented by Gustavo Niemeyer when writing the
web service at geohash.org, and put into the public domain. Geohashes offer properties like
arbitrary precision, similar prefixes for nearby positions, and the possibility of gradually
removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size (and gradually lose precision).

See these resources online:
http://geohash.org
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash
http://openlocation.org/geohash/geohash-js (javascript implementation and demo)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Encode to Geohash Format to an arbitrary level of precision
* Decode from Geohash Format to an arbitrary level of precision
* C implementation is over 10 times faster than native Ruby code (we checked)
* No known problems

== SYNOPSIS:

GeoHash is very easy to use (and fast) because it's written in C with Ruby bindings.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'geohash'

  GeoHash.decode('f77')
  => [63.98438, -73.82813]

  GeoHash.encode(39.51, -76.24)
  => "dr1bc0edrj"
  
  # Decode a geohash to a bounding box
  decode_bbox('dqcw4')
  => [39.0234375, -76.552734375], [39.0673828125, -76.5087890625]]
  
You can encode or decode to an arbitrary level of precision:

# Encode latitude and longitude to a geohash with precision digits
encode(lat, lon, precision=10)

# Decode a geohash to a latitude and longitude with decimals digits
decode(geohash, decimals=5)

Have fun with this!  GeoHash is the new black.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* GCC and a Gnu-ish build environment (for native extensions)

== INSTALLATION

1) Enable gems from github, if you haven't already done so (rubygems >= 1.2):
    > sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

2) Install gem
    > sudo gem install davetroy-geohash

3) Profit!
